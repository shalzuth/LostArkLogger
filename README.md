# How does this work
 This uses raw sockets to read packets and parses data out of them. This does not interact with the game or any other resources, it is only reading the raw packets received to your PC.

# Setup
1.	Download the "Lost Ark Logger" packet logger @ https://github.com/shalzuth/LostArkLogger/releases/latest/download/DpsMeter.exe
2.	To record the pcap for offline mode download @ https://github.com/Xairooo/LostArkLogger/blob/main/Capture.rar
	and extract Capture.rar 

# Guide
1. Before entering a dungeon, launch "Lost Ark Logger" or launch "Capture\startCapture.bat" to capture a pcap file and parse it later.
2. While in the dungeon, "Lost Ark Logger" will log packets - there's a packet log counter, ensure that it is increasing. The log file will be in the same location as "Lost Ark Logger". If the overlay shows weird names that are 8 characters long, you didn't open LostArkLogger.exe before a load screen.
